## Automatic Fields (Set by System)

When you create a creator, these fields are **automatically** set:

```javascript
{
  source: 'MANUAL',                          // Creation method
  importedFrom: 'ADMIN_DASHBOARD',           // Where created from
  createdBy: <YOUR_ADMIN_ID>,                // Your admin user ID
  createdAt: <CURRENT_TIMESTAMP>,            // Creation time
  updatedAt: <CURRENT_TIMESTAMP>,            // Last updated time
  
  profileLink: 'https://instagram.com/...',  // Auto-generated from Instagram
  tags: [category.toLowerCase()]             // Auto-tagged with category
}
```

### Audit Trail
```
- createdBy          → Admin user who created it (tracked)
- createdAt          → When it was created (tracked)
- lastModifiedBy     → Last admin who modified it
- lastModifiedAt     → When it was last modified
```

These fields are **immutable** - they can't be changed and provide a complete audit history.
